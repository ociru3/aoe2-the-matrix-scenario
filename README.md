This project introduces a custom scenario for *Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition*, inspired by the universe of *The Matrix* movie. By combining the strategic elements of the game with the action and dark atmosphere of *The Matrix*, this scenario offers a unique experience for fans of both the game and the film. Players can explore environments that simulate the urban, dystopian aesthetic of *The Matrix*, face challenges adapted to the simulated world, and experience scenes inspired by iconic battles against agents and system adversaries.

The objective is to create an immersive simulation that pays homage to *The Matrix* through the *Age of Empires II* game engine. This custom scenario is designed to provide both a visually rich narrative and a strategic challenge for AoE2 players, using familiar game mechanics to recreate the immersive feel of *The Matrix* universe.

**Scenario Features:**

- **Matrix-Inspired Design:** Environments and structures that recall the urban, dark architecture of the film.
- **Iconic Characters:** Representations of characters like "Neo," "Trinity," and system agents in specific missions and objectives.
- **Dynamic Missions:** Progressive challenges, such as initial survival, prisoner rescues, and battles against agents.
- **Custom Gameplay:** Unique game elements and events that simulate the action and suspense characteristic of *The Matrix*.
